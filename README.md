After following the coursera tutorial I am looking to create a basic web app that can handle several "users", and can handle the addition, editing, and deletion of songs from playlists/libraries etc.

Currently, most of my effort went into 2 things:
1. The most basic implementation of the app (app.py, routes.py, etc.)
2. The beginnings of the data model. This will take some consideration, as I want to implement database normalization standards, and so I'll need to figure out how to create composite PKs, and then FKs between One-to-Many and One-to-One relationships.
